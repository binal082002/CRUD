# CRUD Operation Web Application
This project is a simple web application designed to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It allows users to interact with a list of user data, performing actions such as adding new users, viewing user details, editing user information, and deleting users. The application uses MERN web development technologies.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Provides an introduction to the application and explains the purpose of CRUD operations.
  
- **Navbar**: The navigation bar includes links to pages such as Home, Login, and Register. A user's name is displayed in the navbar when logged in.

- **Login Page**: Handles user authentication. Users can log in by entering their email and password. A token is stored in local storage upon successful login, and the user is redirected to the home page.

- **Registration Page**: Allows new users to create an account by providing their email and password. Upon successful registration, users can log in to the application.

- **User List Page**: Displays a list of users retrieved from the backend server. Users can view user details, edit user information, and delete users from the list.

- **Add User Form**: Users can add new users to the list by providing relevant information such as name, email, and other details.

- **Edit User Form**: Allows users to update existing user information. The form pre-fills with the current user data, enabling users to make necessary changes.

- **Delete User Functionality**: Users can delete users from the list. Upon confirmation, the user is removed from the list.
